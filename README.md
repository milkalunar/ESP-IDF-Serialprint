# How to use Arduino Serial.println() on ESP IDF / VSCode?
Shortly on my [YouTube Channel]([https://github.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqENHeopdPnHLn4WkCQR7w)https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqENHeopdPnHLn4WkCQR7w) I will start ESP IDF tutorials. This repo contains codes on how to use Arduino Serial.println when it is added as a component to ESP IDF. More on Links and Screenshots will be added once video is on release. Keep tuned.
